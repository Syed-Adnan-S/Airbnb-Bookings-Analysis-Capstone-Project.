### Problem statement:

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

Our main aim here is to perform exploratory data analysis on this airbnb bookings data and fetch meaningful insights from it.

### Defining a hypothetical situation:

To not keep this EDA all about coding and some plain insights, I have defined a hypothetical situation to keep the reader connected and interested in the project.
Now, let me tell you about the hypothetical situation. Let us assume that my dad is a wealthy individual who is interested in investing in the real estate market of New York city. His friend has advised him to list out the property he buy's on Airbnb so that he has continuous cash flow from the property.

Now, my dad tells me to research about Airbnb and get to know facts that could help make his investment as profitable as it can get. Me being a data scientist I take the data approach and embark on this journey of getting insights through EDA and making my dad PROUD!!

### Questions to answer:
* Which hosts are the busiest and why.
* For which location do the customers pay the highest and lowest rent.
* Top 5 highest listing areas/locations.
* What is the average preferred price by the customer for each neighbourhood group and for each room type.
* What is the percentage of the total number of nights spent for each neighbourhood group.

### Conclusions: 

After a lot of analysis and also many visualisations we have got the answers to the questions stated above. To see the visualisations you can visit the google colab file.

#### Answers to the questions posed:
   * The busiest hosts are Dona, JJ, Maya, Carol and Danielle. These seem to be the busiest hosts because they have the optimum combination of price(around 60 dollars), availability(around half a year) and number of reviews(around 550). All of these listings also have room type as private room.
   * The neighbourhoods with the highest rents are Upper West side,  Greenpoint, Astoria, Lower East side and East Harlem. The highest rent is 10,000 dollars.
   * The neighbourhoods with the lowest rents are Harlem, Greenpoint, Upper East Side, Upper West Side and SoHo. The lowest rent is 10 dollars.
   * The top 5 highest listed areas are Financial District, Murray Hill, Hell's Kitchen, Midtown and Theater District.
   * The average prices for each neighbourhood group and for each room type is found.
   * The percentage of total nights spent for each neighbourhood group is found.
             
#### Actions I would tell my dad to take:
   * Invest in such a place which can be converted as a private room and be rented out for a price of around 60 dollars per night.
   * Make sure he has proper maintenance of the place so that it is available around the year. (Especially at the beginning and end of the year)
   * Encourage customers to put out reviews about the place by giving gift coupons or future discounts.
   * Try buying a plot in Manhattan, because it has the highest percentage of total nights spent.
   * Buying a place where the rent is the highest is also a good option because it would draw the attention of a lot of people with low prices.
   * It is better to avoid buying in the neighbourhoods with highest number of listings, because the market there is already saturated with good offers.
   * Try pricing the property according to the averages calculated.
