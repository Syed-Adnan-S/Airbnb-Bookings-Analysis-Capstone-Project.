Being in India, my dad is quite skeptical about investing in New York and leaving the property abandoned, He also wants some cash flow to be generated out of the property every now and then. To get out of this dilemma my dad calls his old friend, Mr Robert Kiyosaki (author of the book Rich Dad Poor Dad), he advices my dad to buy the property and list it on some rental services like <b>\"Airbnb\"</b>.
